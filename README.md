# Smartsheet-Discovery-Tool
A tool that extracts sheet, column and field IDs from Smartsheet that can be used in further coding activities for automation and data handling via Smartsheets integrated API.

In order for this to work you will need access to Smartsheet or an API that you can call on (https://developers.smartsheet.com/api/smartsheet/openapi).

If you have an account you can set up your own API.  This link explains how ... https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2482389-generate-API-key?_gl=1*dhpwm*_gcl_au*OTgxMTY1MzguMTczODU5Mzg3OA..*_ga*MTQxNzU0NjgxNS4xNzM4NTkzODY0*_ga_ZYH7XNXMZK*MTc0NTQyMDIwNS4zMy4xLjE3NDU0MjAyODUuNDEuMC4w

With the API code entered you can then see what sheets you have access to.  Select a sheet you want to interogate from a pull down menu and from there you can view all column and field IDs.
